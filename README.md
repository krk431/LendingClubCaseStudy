## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
    I work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    Identify risky loan applicants, then loans to such applicants can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    The data being used contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. It also contains other attributes like loan amount, intreset rate, income and repaying capabilities of applicants etc.
